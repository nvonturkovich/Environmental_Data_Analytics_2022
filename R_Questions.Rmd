Questions:
Is making sure you have pulled all changes as easy as just hitting the pull button, and it tells you its up to date?

I have updated the course README file with my name. Is that the update you need?

Difference between console and terminal?










Notes:
!= different
== equal

Functions:
recipe <_ function(x) {
  mix <- x*2
  return(mix)
}
}

"$" assessing object inside a list

ifelse(x<3, X*2, X/2)

Formatting:
## section 1
## section 2
if you hit collapse all, it will collapse down to these sections

Help:
Within your R chunks in your editor, type in ??function. This will bring up the help pane in the notebook, which you can then navigate through to find what you need.
In the console, type in help(function). This will bring up the help pane in the notebook at the page for that function.
